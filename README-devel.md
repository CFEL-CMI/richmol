Some simple rules for coding on CMInject:

Please
- keep the code consistent across the whole package!
- follow PEP 8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
- use 4 spaces as standard block indentation
- consistently use two empty lines between functions and three empty lines above a class

and use git-flow for branching/merging in git...
