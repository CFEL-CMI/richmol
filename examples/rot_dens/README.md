Here we provide examples of calculations of the rotational density and the expectation
values of operators using the Monte-Carlo sampling approach.

* 'ocs_alignment.py' - simulation of laser-induced 1D alignment of OCS,
  including calculations of rotational density
* 'dens_sampling.py' - computations of expectation values of alignment functions
  using the rotational density (produced, e.g. by in 'ocs_alignment.py')
