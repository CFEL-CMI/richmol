   any symbol calculated, and wigner_type as the (largest of) 3, 6, or
   9 for 3j, 6j, or 9j symbols respectively.  Note that giving
   e.g. max_two_j = 2*100 and wigner_type = 9 only requires < 400 kB
   of memory, such that there is nowadays little point in keeping this

   a slight cache penalty for using larger tables than necessary.
