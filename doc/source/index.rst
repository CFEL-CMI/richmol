Welcome to Richmol's documentation!
===================================

Richmol is a Python package aimed at providing simple and efficient platform for simulations
of ro-vibrational energies, spectra, and dynamics in the presence
of external (laser) and induced internal (hyperfine) electromagnetic fields for general molecule.
Richmol can be interfaced with other variational codes, like `TROVE <https://github.com/Trovemaster/TROVE>`_ and
`Duo <https://github.com/Trovemaster/Duo>`_.

For a quick introduction, see our `README <https://github.com/CFEL-CMI/richmol>`_
and `examples <https://github.com/CFEL-CMI/richmol/tree/develop/examples>`_.
