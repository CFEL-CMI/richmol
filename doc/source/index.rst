Welcome to Richmol's documentation!
===================================

Richmol is a collection of nuclear motion programs powered by Python.
The package aims at providing simple and efficient platform for simulations
of rotational-vibrational energies, spectra, and dynamics in the presence
of external electromagnetic fields for general molecule.
Richmol uses the Python language to implement most of its features,
however the computationally critical parts are implemented with Fortran and C routines.
