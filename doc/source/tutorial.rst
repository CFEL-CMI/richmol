Tutorial
********

This tutorial shows few examples of typical use cases of Richmol.

Quick setup
===========

You can install Richmol from github repo::

  $ git clone https://github.com/CFEL-CMI/richmol
  $ cd richmol
  $ python3 setup.py build
  $ python3 setup.py install --user

A simple example of rotational states calculation
=================================================
Here is an example of computing the rotational energies of camphor molecule (S-enantiomer)
based on the experimental rotational constants::

  >>> xxx
  >>> xxx

Next example shows how one can use the geometry of the molecule (Cartesian coordinates of atoms)
for computing the rotational energies::

  >>>
  >>>

Alternatively, one can use the kinetic :math:`G`-matrix to build the Hamiltonian and compute
the rotational energies::

  >>>
  >>>

We can also play with the embedding of the coordinate axes :math:`x,y,z` in the molecule
by changing the property frame.
